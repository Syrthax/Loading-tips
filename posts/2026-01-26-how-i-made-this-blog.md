So ye making a blog, honestly I am never a writer or a journalist type guy, I hate writing, but recently I joined GitHub developer program which allows me to test api and OAuth tokens of GitHub. I was bored I launched Kiosk android version V1 but I need to wait for testing and feedback from my friends then I realised I can make a blog using GitHub api tokens. 
Basically if you look in the repository of this website you can see it has admin pages too. I dont manually edit html to post blog there's an admin page where I write and I publish it on public page using developer tools. 
While building this, I realised OAuth tokens are temporary and can be fragile in client-heavy flows, whereas GitHub PATs are stable, scoped, and better suited for infrastructure-controlled publishing.

title: "Feedback Loops"

Built ido v2.4.0a with something that completely changed how I work with AI: feedback loops.

Instead of prompting, waiting, prompting again, and wasting credits — I designed a terminal-based feedback loop.

The AI launches the app → waits → I test it → I reply in terminal → it fixes → relaunches → waits again.

No new prompt. No context loss. Just continuous iteration.

This made UI revamps, bug fixes, and feature integration significantly faster and more precise.

It felt less like prompting and more like collaborating.

One thing I realized:
The quality of AI output depends heavily on how well you design the iteration cycle, not just the prompt itself.

Feedback loops turn vibecoding from guesswork into engineering.

Still experimenting and improving this workflow.

Curious to see how far this can go.

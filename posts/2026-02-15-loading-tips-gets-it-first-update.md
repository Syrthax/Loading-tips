# Update (1 Day Before Exams Because Of Course)

So… I genuinely cannot believe I pushed this update literally one day before my exams.

Anyway.

This blog is slowly turning into something more structured than just random thoughts. The biggest change this time: every post now has its own unique link using slugs. Which means I can finally reference specific posts inside my apps whenever I write guides or documentation. That was long overdue.

I also added a **share button** — mostly for myself, if I’m being honest. Now I can bookmark or send a specific post without digging through everything. If you find something useful here, you can share it too.

The UI got a full overhaul. The previous one felt... off. It had that “AI-generated modern template” vibe — clean, but not really me. So I rebuilt it with my aesthetic: glassy layers, subtle animations, smoother transitions. Now it actually feels like something I would use daily.

There’s also a reply mechanism now. If you want to reach out directly, you can. It goes straight to my email. No friction.

This blog is slowly evolving into:

- A space for my thoughts  
- A documentation hub for my projects  
- A place where guides and experiments live  
- And probably a chaos lab in the future  

More coming soon.

(After exams. Hopefully.)
